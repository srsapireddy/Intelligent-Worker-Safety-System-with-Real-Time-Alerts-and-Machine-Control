# Intelligent Worker Safety System with Real-Time Alerts and Machine Control

### Overview
The **Intelligent Worker Safety System with Real-Time Alerts and Machine Control** aims to enhance worker safety on production lines by implementing an automated alert and machine control system. Prioritizing worker safety not only promotes a secure work environment but also builds confidence among employees, ultimately contributing to company growth. This system leverages IP cameras, microcontrollers, and relays to monitor worker proximity to hazardous areas, automatically triggering alerts or shutting down machinery when necessary.

### System Features
1. **Safety Line Alert**: If a workerâ€™s hand crosses the designated safety line, a continuous alarm is triggered. This serves as an immediate warning for the worker to maintain a safe distance from the machinery, reducing the risk of accidents.

2. **Boundary Line Control**: If a worker crosses the boundary line, the system automatically shuts down the machinery. This action is executed through commands from the microcontroller, providing a secondary layer of protection to prevent any hazardous interactions.

### Model Selection and Optimization
For detecting worker movements, object detection models were evaluated:
- **Faster RCNN** was tested but provided unrealistic Mean Average Precision (MAP) values for this specific application.
- **SSD MobileNetV2** was chosen for its performance and computational efficiency, achieving a MAP score between 60 and 70, making it suitable for real-time safety monitoring.

### Technical Components
- **Real-Time Processing**: The system uses SSD MobileNetV2 to analyze video feeds and detect worker movements in real time.
- **Modular Design**: Key components include:
  - **IP Camera** for video capture
  - **Microcontroller** to process alerts based on boundary detections
  - **Relays** for machine power control
- **Automated Machine Control**: When a worker crosses the boundary line, the microcontroller immediately shuts down the machine, preventing accidents.
- **Continuous Alerts**: An audio alarm is activated upon crossing the safety line, ensuring workers are constantly aware of safe working distances.

### Getting Started
To deploy the system:
1. Set up the IP camera for live video feed.
2. Configure the microcontroller to handle alarm and machine control commands.
3. Load and deploy the SSD MobileNetV2 model for real-time monitoring.
4. Connect relays to the microcontroller for automated control of machinery.
